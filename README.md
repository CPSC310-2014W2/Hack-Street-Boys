Weathr is an application that a user can go to for all of their weather needs. The user will be able to login to their google account, and manage their favorite locations. It will also be easy to add new locations to your favorites.

Weathr will also be used for weather tourism. A user of the application will be able to type in exactly what climate he wishes to travel to, and the application will provide the nearest location that satisfies his desires. And of course add that location to his favorites.

Weathr will use the Yahoo weather API for weather data. [https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/]
